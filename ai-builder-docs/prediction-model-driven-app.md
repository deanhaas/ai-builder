# Use your prediction model in Power Apps

[!INCLUDE [cc-data-platform-banner](includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

This topic takes you through the process of creating a model-driven app that can sort your records by the probability value in the AI model output.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information about model-driven apps, see [What are model-driven apps in Power Apps?](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-overview).

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/), select **Apps** from the menu, and then select **Create an app** > **Model-driven** at the top of the screen.
1. On the **Create a New App** screen, complete the fields, and then select **Done**.
1. On the **App Designer** screen, do the following:
    1. Create a view of your entity that contains the predicted fields from the prediction model<!--Edit okay?--> output.
    2. Add the view to the site map.
1. On the **Components** menu, select **Entities**, select your entity, and then select **Back**.
1. Select **Save** at the top of the screen so that you don't lose your progress when you create a view. 
1. Under **Entity view**, select **Views**, and then on the **Components** tab, select **Create New**.
1. On the **Components** tab, select **Column Attributes â€“ Primary Entity**, and then select the fields generated by prediction output.
1. Select **Save And Close**, give your view a name, and then select the view you created. Then select **Save** again. 
1. Select the pencil icon next to **Site Map** and rename **New Group** appropriately. 
1. Select **New Subarea** and select **Entity** as the **Type**, and then select your entity from the **Entity** drop-down menu.
1. Select **Save And Close**, and then select **Publish**.
1. Select **Play**. Your output should look something like the following image.

Congratulations, you've created your first model-driven app that uses an AI Builder prediction model.
