# Transition to the new form-processing model version

AI Builder is improving its form processing model with a new model version. Your form-processing preview models created before March 5, 2020, are deprecated. More information: [Form processing and object detection preview models in AI Builder are deprecated](/power-platform/important-changes-coming#form-processing-and-object-detection-preview-models-in-ai-builder-are-deprecated)

Starting March 5, 2020, you have to re-create your existing form processing models if you want to continue to use them. Models created after this date will automatically use the new model version. It's a good idea to transition to the new model version as soon as possible.

## What do I need to do?

**You must re-create form processing models created before March 5, 2020** 

1. Identify any form-processing models created before March 5, 2020, that you want to continue using.
1. For each model, [create a new form-processing model](create-form-processing-model.md) with the same training documents you used in the original model.
1. After the new model is trained and published, make sure you update any apps or flows to use the new model.
1. After you're done with your deprecated form-processing model, you can delete it.

We understand that you might have spent significant time building your form-processing models. [Contact us](mailto:aihelpen@microsoft.com) if you need help with migrating larger complex models.

## Why this change?

Form-processing models are being upgraded for general availability. Your existing preview models won't be compatible with the new model version.

Until March 5, 2020, form-processing models stored documents as attachments in the Note table. With this update, these models now use the new [File and Image data types](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/blog/introducing-improvements-to-data-storage-in-common-data-services/) in Microsoft Dataverse, enabling a better and more optimized usage of capacity.
