# Text recognition model

The text recognition prebuilt model extracts words from documents and images into machine-readable character streams. It uses state-of-the-art optical character recognition (OCR) to detect printed and handwritten text in images.

This model processes images and document files to extract lines of printed or handwritten text.

## Use in Power Apps

The text recognition prebuilt model is available in Power Apps by using the text recognizer component. More information: [Use the text recognizer component in Power Apps](prebuilt-text-recognizer-component-in-powerapps.md)

## Use in Power Automate

For information about how to use this<!--Suggested.--> model in Power Automate, see [Use the text recognition prebuilt model in Power Automate](flow-text-recognition.md).

## Supported languages, format, and size
