# Entity extraction prebuilt model 

The prebuilt entity extraction model recognizes specific data from text that's of interest to your business. The model identifies key elements from text, and then classifies them into predefined categories. This can help to transform unstructured data into structured data that's machine-readable. You can then apply processing to retrieve information, extract facts, and answer questions.

The prebuilt model is ready to use out of the box. For information about customizing your entity extraction to suit your specific needs, see [Overview of the entity extraction custom model](entity-extraction-overview.md).

## Use in Power Apps

### Explore entity extraction

You can try out the entity extraction model before you import it into your flow by using the "try it out" feature.

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com).
1. In the left pane, select **AI Builder** > **Build**.
1. Under **Get straight to productivity**, select **Entity Extraction**.
1. In the **Entity Extraction** window, select **Try it out**. 
1. Select predefined text samples to analyze, or add your own text in the **Add your own here** box to see how the model analyzes your text.

### Use the formula bar

You can integrate your AI Builder entity extraction model in Power Apps Studio by using the formula bar. More information: [Use formulas for text AI models](use-model.md#use-formulas-for-text-ai-models)

## Use in Power Automate

If you want to use this prebuilt model in Power Automate, you can find more information in [Use the entity extraction prebuilt model in Power Automate](prebuilt-entity-extraction-pwr-automate.md).
