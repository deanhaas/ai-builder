# Add text-based AI models using formulas (preview)

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](./includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

You can integrate some AI Builder models in [Power Apps Studio](https://create.powerapps.com) by using the formula bar. Currently, this functionality is available only for the following AI Builder model types:

* Sentiment analysis
* Entity extraction
* Key phrase extraction
* Language detection

For information about how to use formulas to add these AI models in Power Apps, see [Use formulas for text AI models](use-model.md#use-formulas-for-text-ai-models)
