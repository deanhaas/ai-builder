# Invoice processing model (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The invoice processing prebuilt AI model extracts key invoice data to help automate the processing of invoices. The invoice processing model is optimized to recognize common invoice elements like invoice ID, invoice date, amount due and more.

## Use in Power Apps

For information on how to use the invoice processing prebuilt model in Power Automate, see [Use the invoice processing prebuilt model in Power Apps](prebuilt-invoice-processing-powerapps.md).

## Use in Power Automate

For information on how to use the invoice processing prebuilt model in Power Automate, see [Use the invoice processing prebuilt model in Power Automate](flow-invoice-processing.md).  


## Supported languages and files

Only English invoices from the United States are currently supported.

To get the best results, provide one clear photo or scan per invoice.

- The image format must be JPEG, PNG, or PDF.
- The file size must be less than 20 MB.
- The image dimensions must be between 50 x 50 pixels and 10000 x 10000 pixels.
- PDF dimensions must be at most 17 x 17 inches, which is the equivalent of the Legal or A3 paper sizes or smaller.

## Model output

If an invoice is detected, the invoice processing model will output the following information:

## Create a custom invoice processing solution

The invoice processing prebuilt AI model is designed to extract common fields found in invoices. Because every business is unique, you might want to extract fields other than those included in this prebuilt model. It can also be the case that some standard fields are not well extracted for a particular type of invoice you work with. To address this, there are two options:

- **View raw OCR results**: Every time the invoice processing prebuilt AI model processes a file you provide, it also does an OCR operation to extract every word written on the file. You can access the raw OCR results on the detected text output provided by the model. A simple search on the content returned by detected text might be enough to get the data you need.
- **Use form processing**: With AI Builder, you can also build your own custom AI model to extract specific fields and tables you need for the documents you work with. Just [create a form processing model](form-processing-model-overview.md) and train it to extract all the information from an invoice that doesn’t work well with the invoice extraction model.

Once you train your custom form processing model, you can combine it with the invoice processing prebuilt model in a Power Automate flow.

Here are some examples:

### Use a custom form processing model to extract additional fields that are not returned by the invoice processing prebuilt model

In this example, we have trained a custom form processing model to extract a ‘Loyalty program number’ only present in invoices from providers Adatum and Contoso.

The flow is triggered when a new invoice is added to a SharePoint folder. It then calls the invoice processing prebuilt AI model to extract its data. Next, we check if the vendor for the invoice that has been processed is either from ‘Adatum’ or ‘Contoso’. If it’s the case, we then call a custom form processing model that we’ve trained to get that loyalty number. Finally, we save the extracted data from the invoice in an Excel file.

   > ![Invoice and form processing flow](media/invoice-and-form-process-flow.png "Create a flow that uses a form processing model")

### Use a custom form processing model if the confidence score for a field returned by the invoice processing prebuilt model is low

In this example, we have trained a custom form processing model to extract the total amount from invoices where we usually get a low confidence score when using the invoice processing prebuilt model.

The flow is triggered when a new invoice is added to a SharePoint folder. It then calls the invoice processing prebuilt AI model to extract its data. Next, we check if the confidence score for the 'Invoice total value' property is less than 0.65. If it’s the case, we then call a custom form processing model that we’ve trained with invoices where we usually get a low confidence score for the total field. Finally, we save the extracted data from the invoice into an Excel file.

### Use the invoice processing prebuilt model to handle invoices that a custom form processing model hasn’t been trained to handle

One way to use the invoice processing prebuilt model is to use it as a fallback model to handle invoices that you haven’t trained in your custom form processing model. For example, let's say you built a form processing model, and trained it to extract data from your top 20 invoice providers. You could then use the invoice processing prebuilt model to process all new invoices or lower volume invoices. Here’s an example of how you could do it:

This flow is triggered when a new invoice is added to a SharePoint folder. It then calls a custom form processing model to extract its data. Next, we check if the confidence score for the detected collection is less than 0.65. If it’s the case, it probably means the provided invoice is not a good match for the custom model, so we then call the prebuilt invoice processing model. Finally we save the extracted data from the invoice in an Excel file.
