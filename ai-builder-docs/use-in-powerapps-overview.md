# AI Builder in Power Apps overview

AI Builder provides two kinds of Power Apps components, depending on the models you want to use:

- Components that use prebuilt AI models that are ready to use right away:
  - [Business card reader (canvas app)](business-card-reader-component-in-powerapps.md)
  - [Business card reader (model-driven app)](business-card-reader-component-model-driven.md)
  - [Receipt processor component (canvas app)](prebuilt-receipt-processor-component-in-powerapps.md)
  - [Text recognizer component (canvas app)](prebuilt-text-recognizer-component-in-powerapps.md)

- Components that use custom AI models that you build and train:

  - [Form processor](form-processor-component-in-powerapps.md)
  - [Object detector](object-detector-component-in-powerapps.md)

The AI Builder components for canvas apps are available in Power Apps Studio and appear on the **Insert** tab when you build your canvas app.

## Property name changes in AI Builder components for canvas apps

With the [AI Builder component improvements](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/blog/ai-builder-february-update/) released in April 2020, some of the property names in the AI Builder components for canvas apps have changed. In most cases, your existing apps will be automatically updated to use the new property names without any action required from you. However, in cases where the automatic updates to your app are unsuccessful, here are the property name changes you must make in your apps:

- For the [form processor](form-processor-component-in-powerapps.md) component:

    |Previous property name | New property name |
    |:-------|:-------|
    |{Control Name}.FormContent.Fields |{Control Name}.Fields |
    |{Control Name}.FormContent.Tables |{Control Name}.Tables |


- For the [text recognizer](prebuilt-text-recognizer-component-in-powerapps.md) component:

    |Previous property name | New property name |
    |:-------|:-------|
    |{Control Name}.SelectedText |{Control Name}.Selected.Text |
    |{Control Name}.OcrObjects.text |{Control Name}.Results.Text |

- For the [object detector](object-detector-component-in-powerapps.md) component:

    |Previous property name | New property name |
    |:-------|:-------|
    |{Control Name}.VisionObjects.id |{Control Name}.GroupedResults.TagId |
    |{Control Name}.VisionObjects.displayName |{Control Name}.GroupedResults.TagName |
    |{Control Name}.VisionObjects.count |{Control Name}.GroupedResults.ObjectCount |

If your app uses a **data table** component to display results from the **object detector** component, and you don't see the content after this update, remove the **data table** component from your app, and then add it again. Next, reset the item's property to correctly display the content from the **object detector** component.
