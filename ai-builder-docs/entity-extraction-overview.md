# Overview of the entity extraction custom model (preview)

AI Builder entity extraction models recognize specific data in text that you target based on your business needs. The model identifies key elements in the text and then classifies them into predefined categories. This can help you transform unstructured data into structured data that's machine-readable. You can then apply processing to retrieve information, extract facts, and answer questions.

AI Builder features two types of entity extraction models: prebuilt and custom. [Prebuilt models](prebuilt-overview.md) are ready to use, don't require training or publishing, and are appropriate for many uses where customization isn't needed. Custom entity extraction models must be built, trained, and published before you can use them. By using your own training data and design parameters, you can create an entity extraction model that's purpose-built for your unique requirements.
