# Feature availability by region

AI Builder was initially released in Europe and the United States. Other regions continue to be added; however, the availability and release status of AI Builder features varies by location.

## Which region does my AI Builder subscription belong to?

Your AI Builder models are deployed in the region that hosts your Microsoft Dataverse environment. For example, if your environment is created in the Europe region, your AI Builder models are deployed in datacenters in Europe and are subject to the availability status for Europe.  

## Availability and release status of features by region

The following table shows which AI Builder features are available in each region, and the release status (general availability or preview) for each feature.
