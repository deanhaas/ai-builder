# Use sample data to do form processing

To explore the possibilities of form processing, you can get started by building and training a form-processing model that uses sample invoices.


## Get the sample data

Download [AI Builder Form Processing Sample Data.zip](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2128080), which contains the sample invoices.

## Guided experience on Microsoft Learn

The [Get started with Form processing in AI Builder](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/get-started-with-form-processing/2-create-first-model) in Microsoft Learn walks you through each step of the model creation process using the sample data.
